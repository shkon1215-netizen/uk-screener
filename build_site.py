"""Assemble the static site that GitHub Pages serves.

Reads whatever result files exist and writes a self-contained `site/` folder:

    site/index.html    Main Market
    site/aim.html      AIM
    site/robots.txt    disallow everything
    site/.nojekyll     stop Pages mangling the output

The published pages have no Refresh button - there is no Python behind them.
They are rebuilt on a schedule instead, so the honest thing is to say when the
data was built and when the next build lands, rather than showing a control
that cannot work. Run `python build_site.py` after the screens have run.
